Using for loop
We have data structure called students.

We won't have this kind of small data structure in real time in complex database
we will have Sir name, marks, etc..

var students = {
    1 : {
        name : 'Ram',
        subjects : ['C++', 'Java', 'Python']
    },
    2 : {
        name : 'Sham',
        subjects : ['C++',  'Python']
    },
    3 : {
        name : 'Bham',
        subjects : ['C++', 'Java', 'Python', 'Scala']
    }
}
How to show above data structure to client? We can use
render method and injecting to html file in ejs file
