Parse parameters and pass parameters in the url routes using express

If you want to use student data using studen's ID or roll number
Ex: localhost:3000/student/1

Student 1's data shold be fetched.

(req,res)=>{ is Arrow function.

"""app.get('/student/:id',(req,res)=>{
   res.send('You have requested for student id '+ req.params.id)
});"""

Using express we can do like above, using res.send and req.params.id

If you get message "Cannot GET student"" then there is some spelling mistake
with student in code and browser.

You can also pass name here.

Using dictionary and access data of it.
var students = {
    name : 'ram',
    marks : 67,
    height : 6
}

students is kind of array.

app.get('/students/:name',(req,res)=>{
   res.send('You have requested for student id: '+ student[req.params.name])
});

so calling key with array: student[req.params.name]

Output will be: You have requested for student id: ram
